\section*{Theory}

\subsection*{Bezier curves and Bernstein polynomials}

We have used cubic Bezier curves to approximate a given curve $\gamma$. These are parametrized curves consisting of sums of Bernstein polynomials of the form
\begin{align}
B_{i}^n(t) = \binom{n}{i}t^i(t-1)^{(n-i)},\quad i = 0, 1, ..., 0,\quad t \; \in \; [0,1].
\end{align}
A Bezier curve of degree n is given by
\begin{align}
\mathbf{S}(t) = \sum_{i=0}^{n} \mathbf{P_i} B_{i}^n(t), \quad 0 \leq t \leq 1,
\end{align}
where $\mathbf{P}_i$ are so called control points, which are chosen such that $\mathbf{P}_o$ and $\mathbf{P}_n$ are interpolation points between the Bezier curve and $\gamma$.


\subsection*{Finding control points for best fit}

For the best fit, $\mathbf{P}_1$ and $\mathbf{P}_2$ have to be chosen such that the distance between $\gamma$ and our bezier curve is the small. That is, we needed to minimize the the following expression:

\begin{equation}
E = \frac{1}{m} \sum_{i=1}^{m} \| \mathbf{x}_i - \mathbf{S}(t_i)\|^2_2,
\end{equation}

for parametrization values $t_i \in [ 0,1 ]$ and points $\mathbf{x}_i$ on $\gamma$. To do this we use a property of the Bezier curves: The two straight lines between $\mathbf{P}_0$ and $\mathbf{P}_1$, and $\mathbf{P}_2$ and $\mathbf{P}_3$ are tangents, $\mathbf{v}_0$ and $\mathbf{v}_3$, to the curve at $\mathbf{P}_0$ and $\mathbf{P}_3$ respectively:

\begin{align}
\mathbf{P}_1 = \mathbf{P}_2 + \alpha_1 \mathbf{v}_0 \\
\mathbf{P}_2 = \mathbf{P}_2 + \alpha_2 \mathbf{v}_3
\end{align}

Since $\mathbf{P}_0$ and $\mathbf{P}_3$ are known from the points on the curve $\gamma$, this problem is reduced to finding $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ such that $E$ is small. To find where $E$ is smallest, we differentiate $E$ with respect to $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ and set the expressions to equal zero. To ease the reader we omit the whole process, and only state the resulting system of equations for $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$:


\begin{align}
\alpha_1 \sum_{i = 1}^m B_1(t_i)^2 |\mathbf{v}_0|^2 + \alpha_2 \sum_{i = 1}^m B_1(t_i)B_2(t_i)\mathbf{v}_0 \cdot \mathbf{v}_3 
= - \sum_{i = 0}^m B_1(t_i) \mathbf{v}_0 \cdot \mathbf{A}_i, \\
\alpha_1 \sum_{i = 1}^m B_1(t_i)B_2(t_i)\mathbf{v}_0 \cdot \mathbf{v}_3 + \alpha_2 \sum_{i = 1}^m B_2(t_i)^2 |\mathbf{v}_3|^2 
= - \sum_{i = 0}^m B_1(t_i)\mathbf{v}_3 \cdot \mathbf{A}_i,
\end{align}

where $\mathbf{A}_i = \mathbf{P}_0(B_0(t_i) + B_1(t_i) + \mathbf{P}_3(B_3(t_i) + B_2(t_i)) - \mathbf{x}_i$.





\subsection*{Choosing initial $t$-values and Newton-Raphson Iteration}

To find the parametrization which gives the smallest distance between the Bezier curve and $\gamma$, we differentiate the distance between the two curves with respect to $t$ and equate to 0:

\begin{align}
f(t) =  2(X(t)-x)X'(t) + 2(Y(t)-y)Y'(t) = 0.
\end{align}

Here, $X(t)$ and $Y(t)$ are coordinates on the Bezier curve, and $x$ and $y$ are coordinates on $\gamma$. This is a fifth-degree equation for $t$, and we use the Newton-Raphson iterative method,

\begin{align}
t \gets t - \frac{f(t)}{f'(t)}.
\end{align}

to find the solution. This method will converge for the right starting values for $t$. We use initial $t$-values given by the distance between the data points, $x$ and $y$, from the curve $\gamma$. This method is merely based on \cite{Plass:1983}. Let

\begin{equation}
s_k = \sum_{i=1}^{k-1} \sqrt{(x_{i+1}-x_i)^2 + (y_{i+1}-y_i)^2}
\end{equation}

be the length of the polygonal segment from 1 to $k$, $k$ = 1, 2, ..., $n$. The initial parametric value is then $t_k = s_k/s_n$.

As seen from Figure \ref{fig:Newton-Raphson}, this method converges quickly, so few steps are required for a $t$-value close enough to the root. We can see how the $t$-values in Figure \ref{fig:Newton-Raphson} are quite shifted after 3 iterations, from the green lines to the red lines. It is important that the values are still in range 0 to 1, so this needs to be checked after the iterations.

\end{minipage}
\end{figure}


\subsection*{Dividing the curve in two}
After using Newton-Raphson, if the error between $\gamma$ and the Bezier curve is still above the tolerance, it is possible to divide the curve in two. This can be done simply by choosing the point, $\mathbf{P}_i$, where the error is largest. Figure 2 and Figure 3 show how this splitting is done on an example curve. If $\mathbf{P}_i$ is closer to one of the endpoints than a certain space parameter, we choose to split the curve, $\gamma$, in the midpoint. After splitting, we construct a Bezier curve for each half, using the same method recursively.

\begin{figure}

\begin{minipage}[t]{.4\textwidth}

\vspace{0pt}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{kurvedeling1-crop.pdf}
    \label{fig:kurvedeling1}
    \caption{Before the split. The blue curve is the $\gamma$-curve, and the red curve is the Bezier curve. The black line corresponds to the $t$-value where the error between the curves is biggest.}

\begin{minipage}[t]{.4\textwidth}

\vspace{0pt}
    \includegraphics[scale=0.5]{kurvedeling2-crop.pdf}
    \label{fig:kurvedeling2}
    \caption{After the split. The blue curve us the $\gamma$-curve, and the red is the Bezier curve. The red circle is the end point of the new curves.}
\end{minipage}
\end{figure}

If $\gamma$ has less than 3 points, splitting the curve will not make a better parametrization, since the tangent vectors in both end points will be the same, only with opposite directions.


\subsection*{Unit tangent vectors}
The unit tangent vectors $\mathbf{v}_0$ and $\mathbf{v}_3$ can be found by using the data points $x$ and $y$ around the end points $\mathbf{P}_0$ and $\mathbf{P}_3$. We differ between tangent vectors from corners and tangent vectors that make the curve $C^1$.

A tangent vector that has its origin in a detected corner will only need data points from one side of the end point. The unit tangent vector is  $\mathbf{v}_i = \frac{[1, m_i]^T}{\sqrt{1+m_i^2}}$, where $m_i = (y_{i+r} - y_i)/(x_{i+r} - x_i)$ and $r$ is a positive integer denoting the number of data points away from the end point.

A tangent vector that has its origin in a new control point will need data points from both sides, since the curve should be $C^1$. The unit tangent vector is constructed in the same way as above, only with $m_i = (y_{i+r} - y_{i-r})/(x_{i+r} - x_{i-r})$.


\section*{Numerical experiments}

In this section we will present the results of our algorithm run on different test problems. We will see how smoothness in the corners affects the imaging, and we will see the effects of different values for the space parameter and the error tolerance.


We run our algorithm on the picture shown in Figure~\ref{fig:stitch} with corner detection and $tolerance = 2$. The result was 63 Bezier curves. The algorithm run without corner detection and tangent vectors making the shape $C^1$, gives 75 Bezier curves with the same smoothness parameter. Our image has many sharp edges, so it clearly is advantageous to detect the corners before constructing the Bezier curves. For a shape with smooth edges, the number of Bezier curves often goes slightly down when applying the algorithm without edge detection. This is especially when the tolerance is high.  

The tolerance is a unitless size which depends on the number of data points from the shape. Thus, small images need a lower tolerance to get a good approximation to the shape.  An illustration of this is shown in Figure~\ref{fig:mickey}. The algorithm is run on the same shape with $tolerance = 20$, but with different image size. The smaller set of data points constructs a less accurate fit to the original shape even though the original images look practically the same. 

To be able to reconstruct the Bezier curves, we store the control points for each segment recursively.


If the error between a Bezier curve and the original curve is too large, the curve is divided in two in a new point $\mathbf{P}_i$. To obtain a curve that is $C^1$, the vector must be the tangent in $\mathbf{P}_i$ on the curve, with slope $m_i = (y_{i+r} - y_{i-r})/(x_{i+r} - x_{i-r})$. If the denominator in $m_i$ is close to zero, the unit tangent vector might be badly scaled. To avoid this, we recommend $\mathbf{v}_i = [0,1]$ when $x_{i+r} - x_i$ is below some limit close to zero. One way of choosing $r$ is defining it as a fraction of the total number of data points, rounded upwards to the closest integer. We found that this generally gave better results for different shapes. Remark that $i+r$ or $i-r$ sometimes might range outside the domain of the data points.


In the early stages of our research, we had some problems with the plotting of our Bezier curves; some parts of the curve were not drawn. The reason, we discovered, was that some of our matrices in the calculation of $\alpha_1$ and $\alpha_2$ was singular. This error arises when the tangent vectors, $\mathbf{v}_0$ and $\mathbf{v}_3$, are parallel, which happens when our subset of points are smaller than 3. This is why we included a space limitation in our algorithm which stops the recursion when the subset of points is smaller then a certain space parameter.
